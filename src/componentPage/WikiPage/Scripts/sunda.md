# Sundanese Script

The [Sundanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundanese_script) script is the script utilised in writing the [Sundanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundanese_language "Sundanese language") language.

## Relation to Other Scripts

The Sundanese script developed from [Old Kawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kawi "Old Kawi"). Thus, the script is connected with the [Balinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_alphabet "Balinese alphabet"), [Batak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batak_script "Batak script"), [Baybayin scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin "Baybayin"), [Javanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_script "Javanese script"), [Makasar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makasar_script "Makasar script"), [Lontara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lontara_script "Lontara script"), [Rencong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rencong_script "Rencong script"), and [Rejang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejang_script "Rejang script") scripts.

Sundanese is an **abugida** that constructs syllables by affixing vowel signs to its independent consonants, differing from alphabetic scripts like Latin and Greek that treat vowels as distinct units. What this means is that there are no letters representing consonants or vowels on their own--each letter represents a syllable unit. 


## Writing System
The Sundanese writing system consists of **consonants**, **independent vowels**, **dependent vowels**, **medials**, **final consonants**, and **virama**

* The consonants are by default followed by an inherent a sound. So ᮙ would be read as "ma" instead of "m".
* The independent vowels are vowels that can stand by themselves without having to rely on a consonant. Basically a monosyllabic vowel.
* The vowels diacritics are there to change the inherent a sound to another vowel to create another syllable.
* The virama (᮪), also known as the vowel killer, is used to kill that inherent a sound. So ᮙ (ma) + ᮪ (virama) =  ᮙ᮪ (m).
* The medials are there as intermediate between a consonant and a vowel preceding it. For example, kri would be written as ka + dependent vowel i + medial ra, instead of ka + virama + ra + dependent vowel i.
* Final consonants are consonants that are usually written at the end of a syllable.
