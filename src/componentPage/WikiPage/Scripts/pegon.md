# Pegon Script
The [Pegon Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegon_script) is an [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet)-based writing system historically used to write the Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese language. It originated in the 14th century and has been significant in the cultural and literary heritage of the Javanese, Madurese, and Sundanese characters. Pegon employs Arabic script characters with modifications to suit the phonetics of mainly the Javanese language, which was also extended to Sundanese, and Madurese, incorporating additional symbols to represent specific sounds unique to the languages. While it was once widely used for religious, administrative, and literary purposes, its usage has declined in recent years, with Latin script becoming the predominant writing system in the region. Nonetheless, Pegon script continues to hold cultural and historical importance in Java and Madura Island, and continued to be in the education curriculum of many pesantren (traditional Islamic boarding schools) in Java.

## Writing System
While Pegon is an Arabic-based script, Pegon uses additional characters and diacritics to accommodate the unique sounds of Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese. There are 28 basic characters, including **consonants** and **vowels**. Pegon script is written from right to left, like Arabic. and words are separated by spaces.

Beside the original Arabic letters, Pegon also adds some extra letters to accomodate Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese phonetics:

| Latin   | Standard Latin    | Pegon     | IPA   |
|---------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| p       | p                  | ڤ        | /p/   |
| g       | g                  | ݢ        | /g/   |
| c       | c                  | چ        | /t͡ʃ/  |
| v       | v                   | ۏ‎ | /v/   |
| n_g     | ng                  | ڠ        | /ŋ/   |
| n_y     | ny                  | ڽ‎  | /ɲ/   |

### Vowels :
Writing vowels in Pegon is almost the same as in Arabic by using diacritics (harakat) around the modified consonant: 

| Latin   | Standard Latin    | Pegon     | IPA   |
|---------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| a       | a                  | ـَ        | /a/   |
| i       | i                  | ـِ        | /i/   |
| u       | u                  | ـُ        | /u/  |
| ^a     | ā                  | ـٰ        | /ŋ/   |
| ^i     | ī                  | ـٖ  | /ɲ/   |
| ^u     | ū                  | ـٗ  | /ɲ/   |
| an-     | an                  | ـً  | /an/   |
| in-     | in                  | ـٍ  | /in/   |
| un-     | un                  | ـٌ  | /un/   |
| an_     | an                  | ـࣰ  | /an/   |
| in_     | in                  | ـࣲ   | /in/   |
| un_     | un                  | ـࣱ  | /un/   |
| ^W     | u                  | ۥ  | /u/   |
| ^Y     | i                  | ۦ  | /i/   |
| ^m     | m                  | ـۢ  | /m/   |

Like the consonants, it also has some extra diacritics not available in Arabic to accomodate Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese phonetics:

| Latin   | Standard Latin    | Pegon     | IPA   |
|---------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| ^e       | ê                  | ـٓ        | /ʔ/   |
| e       | e                  | ـَى        | /e/   |
| o       | o                  | ـَو        | /o/  |

For marking the vocal of a syllable at the end of a word, we must also add another character such alif, ya, and wauw instead of using only harakat:

| Latin   | Standard Latin    | Pegon     | IPA   |
|---------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| a       | a                  | ا      | /a/   |
| i       | i                  | ى/ي      | /i/   |
| u       | u                  | و       | /u/  |

We can add sukun (ـۡ) to represent an absance of vowel with ".".
