# Tai Le Script

The [Tai Le](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Le_script) script is used to write [ Tai Nüa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_N%C3%BCa_language "Tai Nüa language"), [Ta'ang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaung_language "Palaung language"), [Blang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blang_language "Blang language"), and [Achang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achang_language "Achang language") languages.


## Relation to Other Scripts

The Tai-Le script developed from [the Mon–Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon%E2%80%93Burmese_script "Mon–Burmese script") script. Thus, the script is connected with the [Ahom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahom_script "Ahom script") and [Khamti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khamti_script "Khamti script") scripts

Tai-Le is an **abugida** that constructs syllables by affixing vowel signs to its independent consonants, differing from alphabetic scripts like Latin and Greek that treat vowels as distinct units. What this means is that there are no letters representing consonants or vowels on their own--each letter represents a syllable unit.


## Writing System
The Tai-Le writing system consists of **consonants**, **final consonants**, **vowels**, **special vowels**, and **tones**

* Consonants are followed by an inherent /a/ sound, unless it is followed by a vowel.
* Final Consonants are consonants that may end without being followed by another vowel. For example, ᥥᥛ would be read as /em/ instead of /ema/

### Final Consonants

| Standard Latin | Reversible Latin    | Tai-Le | Phonetic Reading (IPA) |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | --- |

### Vowels

| Standard Latin | Reversible Latin | Tai-Le | IPA |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| a       | `a`       | ᥣ      | /a/ |
| i       | `i`      | ᥤ      | /i/|
| e        | `e`       | ᥥ      | /e/ |
| è        | `ee`       | ᥦ      | /ɛ/ or /ia/ |

| î        | `^u`       | ᥪ      | /ɯ/ |
| aî        | `a^u`       | ᥬ      | /aɯ/ |
| ai        | `ai`       | ᥭ      | /ai/ |

Special vowels are basically vowels that are a mix of two vowels to create a new sound. It's also known as special syllables in this case. 

* When all vowels except ᥤ[i], ᥦ[ɛ], and ᥬ[aɯ] is met with ᥭ[ai], the vowels will be followed by an -i instead of an -ai. Example: ᥩ[o] + ᥭ[ai] = ᥩᥭ[oi]
* When ᥣ[a] meets ᥭ[ai], however, it becomes ᥣᥭ[a:i]
* When all vowels except ᥧ[u], ᥨ[ɔ], and ᥬ[aɯ] is met with the consonant ᥝ[w], the vowels will be followed by an -u instead of a -w. Example: ᥥ[e] + ᥝ[w] = ᥥᥝ[au]
* When ᥣ[a] meets ᥝ[w], however, it becomes ᥣᥝ[a:u]

### Tones

| Standard Latin | Reversible Latin | Tai Le | IPA  |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ---- |
| - (high-level tone)      | `#2`      |ᥰ      | - (tone 2) |
| - (low-level tone)      | `#3`       | ᥱ       | - (tone 3)  |
| - (mid-fall tone)      | `#4`       | ᥲ       | - (tone 4)  |
| - (high-fall tone)      | `#5`       | ᥳ       | - (tone 5)  |
| - (mid-rise tone)      | `#6`       | ᥴ       | - (tone 6)  |

By default, unmarked syllables would follow tone 1.
