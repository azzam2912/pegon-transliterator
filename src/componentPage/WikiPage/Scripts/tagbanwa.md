# Tagbanwa Script


[Tagbanwa script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagbanwa_script) is mainly utilised to write the [Central Tagbanwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Tagbanwa_language), [Calamian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calamian_Tagbanwa_language), and [Aborlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aborlan_Tagbanwa_language) languages.


## Relation to Other Scripts

The Tagbanwa script developed from [the Baybayin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin). Thus, the script is connected with the [Buhid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buhid_script), [Hanunoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanunoo_script), and other scripts.

Tagbanwa is an **abugida** that constructs syllables by affixing vowel signs to its independent consonants, differing from alphabetic scripts like Latin and Greek that treat vowels as distinct units. What this means is that there are no letters representing consonants or vowels on their own--each letter represents a syllable unit. 


## Writing System
The Tagbanwa writing system consists of **independent consonants**, **independent vowels**, and **dependent vowels**

* Independent consonants by default are followed by the "a" vowel. For example ᝧ  by itself would be read as "da".
* Independent vowels are vowels that can stand by itself. It is used when writing a syllable that consists of only one vowel and no consonant. For example, "*ika*" would be written as ᝡᝣ.
* Dependent vowels are vowels that cannot stand on its own. Usually it is attached to a consonant in order to function. For example, bi would be written as ᝪᝲ.
