## What is Aksarantara ?

As times went by, many languages became obsolete and gradually fell out of use. May it be due to the reluctance of speaking ones own languages in favour of another language, or other reasons, the fact that languages are dying alongside their marvellous scripts is a call to us to preserve them for the future generations to witness.

Aksarantara is a solution dedicated to preserving Southeast Asian languages, manuscripts, and scripts. With the growth of technologies these past decades, a matter of preservation is made facile. By digitising the manuscripts, Aksarantara is trying to preserve ancient manuscripts from the erosion of time.

The means of preservation does not stop there. Aksarantara utilises the powerful OCR feature to facilitate reading manuscripts, aiding scholars and hobbyists alike. Furthermore, by employing many ways of transliteration, communities all around the globe can now learn to write Southeast Asian scripts of their choices.

## Transliteration 

The transliteration section is intended to aide learners of Southeast Asian scripts on how to read those scripts by transliterating latin to those particular scripts. There exist two types of latin scripts, reversible latin and irreversible latin. Reversible latin is used to ease the process of transliterating, while irreversible latin is used to help readers to understand the sound made by the transliteration machine by adding some diacritics, etc.

## OCR 

The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) feature utilises a powerful AI technology to read Southeast Asian characters from pictures of said scripts. You can upload an image and in return, receive the manuscript in the text format.
